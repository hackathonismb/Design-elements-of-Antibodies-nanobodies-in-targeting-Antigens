What is the problem we are trying to solve?  Comparing the structures of antibodies and nanobodies relative to each other in a 3D and 2D visualization platform with respect to SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein will allow us to understand the details of the intermolecular interactions.  
Why should we solve it? Antibodies are widely used in a number of applications.  Understanding the particular residue or domain epitope-paratope interactions can help in predicting binding interactions which can assist in the area of drug design and therapeutics. A functional understanding of antibody-nanobody interactions within the  SARS-CoV2 RBD domain with computational tools can complement and accelerate the wet-lab research. The change sin SARS-CoV2
