What is the problem we are trying to solve?  Comparing the structures of antibodies and nanobodies relative to each other in a 3D and 2D visualization platform with respect to SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein will allow us to understand the details of intermolecular interactions.  
Why should we solve it? Monoclonal antibodies are widely used in a number of applications and especially in the area of drug design and therapeutics.
